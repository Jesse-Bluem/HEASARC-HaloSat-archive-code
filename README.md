# HEASARC-HaloSat-archive-code

This is the code used to process the HaloSat data for archival with HEASARC.
My searchdb tool forms the basis for this process, but I did not write the other pieces of code.
I was responsible for the third HEASARC data archival and updating these pieces of code for Python 3 in the process.
I also made numerous bug fixes, which are summarized as comments in affected pieces of code.
